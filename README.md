# What is This?

The initial script is Taken from Rob Conery's post on [Creating a Massively Scalable WordPress Site on Azure's Hosted Bits](https://rob.conery.io/2019/01/09/creating-a-massively-scalable-wordpress-site-on-azures-hosted-bits/) / [Gist](https://gist.github.com/robconery/b3d1ab3146f777707a6d6fb2e851cc8d). There were a few shortcomings to this script, and I felt a moment of insanity so I decided to modify a few things.

## Changes
 - PHP Settings
 - WordPress Volume
